s.description      = <<-DESC
**Sync** eases your everyday job of parsing a `JSON` response and getting it into Core Data. It uses a convention-over-configuration paradigm to facilitate your workflow.

* Automatic mapping of CamelCase or snake_case JSON into Core Data
* Handles operations in safe background threads
* Thread-safe saving, we handle retrieving and storing objects in the right threads
* Diffing of changes, updated, inserted and deleted objects (which are automatically purged for you)
* Auto-mapping of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many)
* Smart-updates, only updates your `NSManagedObject`s if the server values are different (useful when using `NSFetchedResultsController` delegates)
* Uniquing, Core Data does this based on `objectID`s, we use your primary key (such as `id`) for this
