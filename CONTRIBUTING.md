GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in **Sync**. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Sync), [FAQ](https://github.com/SyncDB/Sync/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/SyncDB/Sync/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application or a feature request, an example of your **JSON** and your **Core Data model** or a **stacktrace** would be really helpful for us to be able to reproduce your issue or understand your request, please consider adding these things before making an issue.
