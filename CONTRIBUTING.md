GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback in **Sync**. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/Sync), [FAQ](https://github.com/3lvis/Sync/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/3lvis/Sync/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application or a feature request, an example of your **JSON** and your **Core Data model** or a **stacktrace** would be really helpful for us to be able to reproduce your issue or understand your request, please consider adding these things before making an issue.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/Sync).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
