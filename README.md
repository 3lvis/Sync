>**quipu [*kee-poo*, *kwip-oo*]**: Sometimes called talking knots, were recording devices historically used in the region of Andean South America. A system also used for collecting data and keeping records, ranging from monitoring tax obligations, properly collecting census records, calendrical information, and military organization.

Kipu eases your every day job of parsing a `JSON` response and getting it into CoreData. It uses a convention over configuration paradigm to facilitate your workflow.

* Handles operations in safe background threats
* Thread safe saving, we handle retrieving and storing objects in the right threads
* Diffing of changes, updated, inserted and deleted objects (which are automatically purged for you)
* Auto-mapping of relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many)
* Smart-updates, only updates your NSManagedObjects if the server values are different (useful when using NSFetchedResultsController delegates)
* Uniquing, CoreData does this based on `objectID`s, we use your remote key (such as `id`) for this

## Interface

```objc
+ (void)processChanges:(NSArray *)changes
       usingEntityName:(NSString *)entityName
            completion:(void (^)(NSError *error))completion
```

* `changes`: JSON response
* `entityName`: Core Data's Model Entity Name (such as User, Note, Task)

## Real World Example

#### Model

![Model](https://github.com/NSElvis/Kipu/blob/master/Images/coredata-model.png)

#### JSON

```json
[
  {
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Shawn Merrill",
    "email": "shawn@ovium.com",
    "created_at": "2014-02-14T04:30:10+00:00",
    "updated_at": "2014-02-17T10:01:12+00:00",
    "notes": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "text": "Shawn Merril's diary, episode 1",
        "created_at": "2014-03-11T19:11:00+00:00",
        "updated_at": "2014-04-18T22:01:00+00:00"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### Kipu

```objc
[Kipu processChanges:JSON
     usingEntityName:@"User"
          completion:^{
              // Objects saved in CoreData, do something
           }];
```
**PROFIT!**

## Requirements

`iOS 7`, `CoreData`, [`ANDYDataManager CoreData stack`](https://github.com/NSElvis/ANDYDataManager)

## Components

**Kipu** wouldn't be possible without the help of this *fully tested* components:

* [**ANDYDataManager**](https://github.com/NSElvis/ANDYDataManager): CoreData stack and thread safe saving

* [**NSManagedObject-ANDYMapChanges**](https://github.com/NSElvis/NSManagedObject-ANDYMapChanges): Helps you purge deleted objects, internally we use it to diff inserts, updates and deletes. Also it's used for uniquing CoreData does this based on objectIDs, ANDYMapChanges uses your remote keys (such as id) for this

* [**NSManagedObject-HYPPropertyMapper**](https://github.com/hyperoslo/NSManagedObject-HYPPropertyMapper): Maps JSON fields with their CoreData counterparts, it does most of it's job using the paradigm "_convention over configuration_"

## Getting Started

### Installation

**Kipu** is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

`pod 'Kipu'`

### ANDYDataManager

Replace your CoreData Stack with this:

```objc
- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application
{
    [[ANDYDataManager sharedManager] persistContext];
}
```
Replace any call to your `managedObjectContext` used in the main thread with this:

```objc
[[ANDYDataManager sharedManager] mainContext];
```

### NSManagedObject-HYPPropertyMapper

Your CoreData models should match your backend entities, your classes can have a different name.
Your fields should match their JSON counterparts. For example `first_name` maps to `firstName`, `address` to `address`.

There are only two exceptions to this rule:

* `id`s should match `entityNameID`, for example for an entity user the `id` should match `userID`
* `created_at` and `updated_at` should match `createdDate` and `updatedDate`

### Networking

You are free to use any networking library or NSURLConnection.

### Finally

You are ready to go, check the [Simplify Example](https://github.com/NSElvis/Kipu#real-world-example) or the [Example Project that uses App.net](https://github.com/NSElvis/Kipu/tree/master/Example) for how to use Kipu.
